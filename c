## Project Structure Before Starting Code :)
- CRUD operations for users, products
- User (username, email, password, role)
- Authentication (register, login, logout, forgotpassword, resetpassword)
- Product (name, description, price, image)
- Roles are ['user', 'admin']
- Role 'user' can create and update product BUT cannot delete product
- Role 'admin' can delete product also has full controll for user crud operations
